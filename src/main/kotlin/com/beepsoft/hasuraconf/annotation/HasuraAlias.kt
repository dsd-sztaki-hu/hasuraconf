 * class. In this case the ID's od the two ends of the join (@{code joinColumnAlias/keyColumnAlias} and
 * @{code inverseJoinColumnAlias/relatedColumnAlias}) can be redefined, as well as the object reference name
 * via {@code joinFieldAlias}. These join tables also have their own root fields, which can be customized using
 * a {@code @HasuraRootFields} annotation set in the {@code rootFieldAliases} parameter.
